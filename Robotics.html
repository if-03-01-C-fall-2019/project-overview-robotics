          <h2>About robotics</h2>
          <p>Robotics consist out of engineering and science that includes            mechanical engineering,<br>
             electronic engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others.<br>
          <p>The people that are developing them deal with the design,                construction, operation,<br>
             and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and<br>
              information processing.</p>
         <h3>Use cases for Robots</h3>
             <p>They are often used in dangerous environments(for example bomb detection and deactivation)</p>
             <p>Another use case is where humans cannot survive(for example in space, underwater, in high heat or cleaning hazardous materials.</p>
